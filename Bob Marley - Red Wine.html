<pre class="lyrics">Red, red wine
Go to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so

Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
Now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart

I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of her
Would leave my head
I was wrong
And I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart

Red red wine you make me feel so fine
You keep me rocking all of the time
Red red wine you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollars when your just in my hand
Red red wine you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go it make me feel bad
Red red wine you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him rizla pon the sweet dep line
Red red wine you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing mek me do me own thing
Red red wine you really know how fi love
Your kind of loving like a blessing from above
Red red wine I love you right from the start
Right from the start with all of my heart
Red red wine in a 80's style
Red red wine in a modern beat style, yeah

Give me little time, help me clear up me mind
Give me little time, help me clear up me mind
Give me Red wine because it make me feel fine
Mek me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him rizla on the sweet dep line
The line broke, the monkey get choke
Burn bad ganja pon him little rowing boat

Red red wine I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you cause I know you love true
Red red wine I'm gonna love you till I die
Love you till I die and that's no lie
Red red wine can't get you out my mind
Where ever you maybe I'll surely find
I'll surely find, make no fuss just stick with us.

Give me little time, help me clear up me mind
Give me little time, help me clear up me mind
Give me Red wine because it make me feel fine
Mek me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him rizla on the sweet dep line
The line broke, the monkey get choke
Burn bad ganja pon him little rowing boat

Red red wine you really know how fi love
Your kind of loving like a blessing from above
Red red wine I love you right from the start
Right from the start with all of my heart
Red red wine you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing mek me do me own thing
Red red wine in a 80's style
