<pre class="lyrics">Every fight needs mending 
Every start has an end 
Like the sunrise and the sunset 
That's just how it is
Love on borrowed time 
Will never be yours nor mine 
I need you like you need me 
The way we ought to be
Oh, it's good to be true, 
If our hopes and dreams come true 
Wish that I had more 
Of this borrowed time 
If only it would last a lifetime.
This bitterness inside 
Is an empty space I hide 
It never satisfies 
Living my life in a lie
Love on borrowed time 
Will never be yours nor mine 
I'll just close my eyes 
And it will be alright
Oh, it's good to be true, 
If our hopes and dreams come true 
Wish that I had more 
Of this borrowed time 
If only it would last a lifetime.
Now that you've gone away 
You seem so close 
But you're miles and miles away
Oh, it's good to be true, 
If our hopes and dreams come true 
Wish that I had more 
Of this borrowed time 
If only it would last.
Oh, it's good to be true, 
If our hopes and dreams come true 
Wish that I had more 
Of this borrowed time 
If only it would last.
Oh, it's good to be true, 
If our hopes and dreams come true 
Wish that I had more 
Of this borrowed time 
If only it would last a lifetime.</pre>
