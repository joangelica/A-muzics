<pre class="lyrics">Will it ever be?
I've tried so hard to find sweet serenity
Are you still afraid?
Just close your eyes and dream, and fear will fade away.
Time won't flow, everyone knows
When the pain fades away
And dreams won't die, with tears in our eyes
You've got to hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
It's taken some time
And I've given up the will to change your state of mind
Try and understand
It's not so hard to see that I am just a man
Time won't flow, everyone knows
When the pain fades away
And dreams won't die, with tears in our eyes
You've got to hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
So will it ever be?
I've tried so hard to find sweet serenity
Try and understand
It's not so hard to see that I am just a man
Time won't flow, everyone knows
When the pain fades away
And dreams won't die, with tears in our eyes
You've got to hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...
Hold your head up high...</pre>
